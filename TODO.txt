    Note array, escape, and other differences; READ IT ALL!
Prompt Elements
    etc symbols (view inspiration, spaceship prompt, other mac prompts)
Customizability with prompt options to include
Improve symbols before the branch name (more than if it's dirty and the branch name)
    https://blog.backslasher.net/git-prompt-variables.html; not much anymore here
Update rename and copied symbols in help alias
    Improve interpretability of all symbols themselves (best fit? view inspiration)
Scheduled Task tutorial, files
Updaterc, profile, etc aliases
Make sure to check versions, ANYTHING if continue with spaceship installations at .bash_profile if possible
    Checking node --version, for example, takes .117s each time; you don't want this to happen every terminal session.
    However, checking if the file exists takes .000 seconds, and only in spoecific directories would the .1s be added on. So MOST can be added to bash.bashrc, as it is just verifying location in an instantaneous if statement.
Fixup venv creation in cygwin
Add if-else format to help concise code
    [ true ] && success || failure
